Instructions for compilation:




How to run the test cases:

After compiling, a set of operations list appears which prompts you to enter an operation code according to your choice. 

On choosing an operation code:

0)Exit 
- This operation exits the program. 

1) Find the shortest path
- This operation is used to find the shortest path from the start to the end vertex. 
INPUT:
   - The following information must be entered:
   a)The starting vertex:
   - This is the starting point of the travel from where you'd like to begin. Enter an integer ranging from 0 to 19. 
   b)The destination vertex:
   - This is the final destination of the travel where you'd like to end. Enter an integer ranging from 0 to 19. 
   c)Time of travel:
   - Enter the time at which you begin your journey from the starting point in 24 hour format (ie hours:minutes).
OUTPUT:


4)Print Graph 
- This operation prints the graph using adjacency list implementation. 
  For example 1->{2,3,5}, means 1 is the starting vertex and 2,3,5 are three different end vertices containing an edge starting from 1.
